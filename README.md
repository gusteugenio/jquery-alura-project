# Word Counting Game with jQuery

This repository contains a project developed using jQuery as part of the [jQuery course from Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/jquery-a-biblioteca-do-mercado). The project is a word-counting game where players must type the correct word within a limited time.

## How It Works
- **Gameplay**: Players are given a few seconds to type the correct word(s) displayed in the game. The timer counts down, and players need to complete the task before it reaches zero.
- **Restart Option**: After each round, players can restart the game to try again.
- **Score Tracking**: When the game ends, a score is recorded, capturing each attempt and allowing players to track their performance.

Enjoy practicing your typing speed and accuracy with this fun jQuery-based game!
